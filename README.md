## Hello dear

## It took to finish this project less than a day ago, for me it was very simple and his ideas simple.
## I have a previous experience with API and also CoreData, so it was not difficult at all.

## I added some features to the project including:
1- A special page about the details of the movie
2. You can delete the movie from your favorites


## In the end, I think the test offers a very fascinating practice for beginners in applications development.
